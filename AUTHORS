NorJS Runtime Environment was created in late 2018 at Sendanor in Finland, EU.

Here is an inevitably incomplete list of MUCH-APPRECIATED CONTRIBUTORS --
people who have submitted patches, reported bugs, added translations, helped
answer newbie questions, and generally made NorJS that much better:

    Jaakko-Heikki Heusala <jheusala@iki.fi>
    Teemu Kuutti <teemu@identio.fi>

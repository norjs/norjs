# The NorJS Runtime Environment.

This is a MIT-licensed runtime environment for apps created with our 
not-yet-published commercial *NorJS Development Environment*, **however** *it 
will run any compatible AngularJS ES6 app as well*.

*The NorJS RE* is still under active development and there is no official 
stable release until we release it to the first commercial customer. 

You may follow the progress in [the feature issue #1](https://github.com/norjs/norjs/issues/1).

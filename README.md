# The NorJS Runtime Environment.

This is a MIT-licensed runtime environment for apps created with our 
not-yet-published commercial NorJS development environment, **however** *it 
will run any compatible AngularJS ES6 app as well*.

The NorJS RE is still under active development and there is no official stable 
release until we release it to the first commercial customer. 

You may follow the progress in the feature issue #1.
